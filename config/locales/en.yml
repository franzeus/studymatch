# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    about_us_text: "StudyMatch was created in 2011 by two Austrian students, who played that game - guessing the study of passing students - in real life. In 2013 we decided to have a relaunch and optimize this app for mobile and non-german speaking dudes (so that more people can waste time with it). We hope you have as much fun as we have :)"
