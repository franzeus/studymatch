# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    about_us_text: "StudyMatch was created in 2011 by two Austrian students, who first guessed the subject of passing students in real life. In 2013 we decided to optimize this app for mobile and non-german speaking dudes (so that more people on earth can waste their time with it). Anyways, we hope you have as much fun as we have :)"
